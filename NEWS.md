# tidypolars (development version)

## Breaking changes and deprecations

* `as_polars()` is now removed. It was deprecated in 0.7.0. Use `as_polars_df()`
  or `as_polars_lf()` instead.
  
* For consistency with `dplyr`, the behavior of `collect()` will change in 0.8.0
  as it will perform the lazy query **and** convert the result to a standard
  `data.frame`. For now, `collect()` only throws a warning about this future 
  change. It is recommended to use `compute()` to only perform the query and get
  a Polars DataFrame as output (#101).

## New features

* Several improvements and changes for `pivot_wider()` (#95):

  * `names_from` can now takes several variables;
  * add support for `id_cols` and `names_glue`;
  * default value of `names_sep` now is `_`, for consistency with `tidyr`;
  * fix documentation as `pivot_wider()` doesn't work on LazyFrame.
  
* Add support for `stringr::regex()`. Note that only the argument `ignore_case`
  is supported for now (#97).

# tidypolars 0.6.0

`tidypolars` requires `polars` >= 0.15.0.

## Breaking changes and deprecations
  
* `as_polars()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.7.0. Use `as_polars_lf()`
  or `as_polars_df()` instead.

* `as_polars()` doesn't have an argument `with_string_cache` anymore. When set
  to `TRUE`, this enabled the string cache globally, which could lead to 
  undesirable side effects.
  
* `to_r()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.7.0. Use `as.data.frame()` or
  `as_tibble()` instead. This used to silently return a `LazyFrame` if the 
  input was `LazyFrame`. It now automatically collects the `LazyFrame` (#88).
  
* `pull()` nows automatically collects input `LazyFrame` (#89).
  
## New features

* Add support for argument `.keep` in `mutate()` (#80).

* Add support for `group_vars()` and `group_keys()` (#81).

* **Experimental** support of `rowwise()`. For now, this is limited to a few 
  functions: `mean()`, `median()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `all()`, `any()`. 
  `rowwise()` and `group_by()` cannot be used at the same time (#40).
  
* All functions that return a polars `Data/LazyFrame` now add the class 
  `"tidypolars"` to the output (#86).

* Support `which.min()`, `which.max()`, `dplyr::n()`.

* Support `.data[[` and `.env[[` in addition to `.data$` and `.env$`. Better
  error messages when the objects specified in `.data` or `.env` don't exist.
  
## Bug fixes

* `pull()` now errors when `var` is of length > 1.


# tidypolars 0.5.0

`tidypolars` requires `polars` >= 0.12.0.

## Breaking changes

* `across()` now errors if the argument `.cols` is not provided (either named or
  unnamed). This behavior was deprecated in `dplyr` 1.1.0.
  
* It is no longer possible to use `!` in `arrange()` to sort by decreasing order,
  for compatibility with `dplyr::arrange()`. Use `-` or `desc()` instead.
  
## New features

* `summarize()` now works on ungrouped data and returns a 1-row output.

* It is now possible to use `desc(x1)` in `arrange()` to sort in decreasing 
  order of `x1` (this is equivalent to `-x1`).
  
* Add support for argument `names_prefix` in `pivot_longer()`.

* Add support for arguments `names_prefix` and `names_sep` in `pivot_wider()`.

* Add support for `tidyr::uncount()`.

* All `*_join()` functions now work when `by` is a specification created by 
  `dplyr::join_by()`. Notice that this is limited to equality joins for now.
  
* You can now use the "embrace" operator `{{ }}` to pass unquoted column names
  (among other things) as arguments of custom functions. See the ["Programming
  with dplyr" vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/programming.html)
  for some examples.
  
* `bind_cols_polars()` now works with two `LazyFrame`s, but not more.

* Add support for argument `.name_repair` in `bind_cols_polars()` (#74).

* Support for `.env$` and `.data$` pronouns in expressions of `filter()`, 
  `mutate()` and `summarize()`.
  
* Support named vector in the argument `pattern` of `str_replace_all()`, where
  names are patterns and values are replacements.
  
* Using `%in%` for factor variables doesn't require enabling the string cache
  anymore.

## Bug fixes

* `summarize()` no longer errors when `across(everything(), ...)` is used with
  `.by`.

* All `*_join()` functions no longer error when a named vector is provided in 
  the argument `by`.
  
* Expressions with values only are not named "literal" anymore.

## Misc

* Simplify the procedure to support new functions.


# tidypolars 0.4.0

`tidypolars` requires `polars` >= 0.11.0.

## Breaking changes

* It is no longer possible to pass a list in `rename()`. 

## New features

* The argument `with_string_cache` in `as_polars()` now enables the string cache
  globally if set to `TRUE` (#54).
  
* Better error message in `filter()` when comparing factors to strings while the
  string cache is disabled.
  
* Basic support for `strptime()`. It is possible to use `strptime(*, strict = FALSE)`
  to not error when the parsing of some characters fails.

* New argument `.by` in `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()`, and new 
  argument `by` in the `slice_*()` functions. This allows to do operations on
  groups without using `group_by()` and `ungroup()`. See the 
  [`dplyr` vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_by.html) for 
  more information (#59).
  
* `rename()` now accepts unquoted names both old and new names.

* Support fixed regexes in `str_detect()` (using `fixed()`) and in `grepl()` 
  (using `fixed = TRUE`).

## Bug fixes

* Improve robustness of sequential expressions in `mutate()` and `summarize()` 
  (i.e expressions that should be run one after the other because they depend on
  variables created in the same call) (#58).
  
* `relocate()` now works correctly when `.after = last_col()`.

* All functions that work on grouped data now correctly restore the groups 
  structure (#62).
  
## Misc

* Error messages coming from `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `filter()` now give 
  the right function call. 

* Faster tidy selection (#61).


# tidypolars 0.3.0

`tidypolars` requires `polars` >= 0.10.0.

## Breaking changes

* All functions starting with `pl_` have been removed to the benefit of the S3
  methods. For example, `pl_distinct()` doesn't exist anymore so the only way to
  use it is to load `dplyr` and to use `distinct()` on a Polars DataFrame or
  LazyFrame. This is to avoid confusion about compatibility with `dplyr` and 
  `tidyr`. See #49 for a more detailed explanation.
  
* `pl_bind_rows()` and `pl_bind_cols()` are renamed `bind_rows_polars()` and
  `bind_cols_polars()` respectively. This is because `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()`
  are not S3 methods (this might change in future versions of `dplyr`).

## New features

* New function `duplicated_rows()` that is the opposite of `distinct()` (#50).

* New argument `.id` in `bind_rows_polars()`.

* `bind_rows_polars()` can now bind Data/LazyFrames that don't have the same 
  schema. Columns will be upcast to common types if necessary. Unknown columns 
  will be filled with `NA`.
  
## Bug fixes

* `complete()` now works correctly on grouped data.

## Misc

* `relig_income` and `fish_encounters` are not reexported anymore since `tidyr` 
  is now imported.
  

# tidypolars 0.2.0

`tidypolars` requires `polars` >= 0.9.0.

## New features

* Rename `pl_fetch()` to `fetch()`.

* New functions supported: `describe()`, `sink_csv()`, `slice_sample()`.

* New argument `fill` in `pl_complete()`.
  
* Support `stringr::str_to_title()` and `tools::toTitleCase()`.

* Support `stringr::fixed()` to use literal strings.

* Support replacements with captured groups like `\\1` in `stringr::str_replace()`
  and `stringr::str_replace_all()`.

## Bug fixes

* `sink_parquet()` didn't use the user inputs (apart from the `path`).
  
## Misc

* Clearer error message when an expression contains `<pkg>::`. This is not 
  supported for now but could potentially be implemented later.

* `pl_colnames()` is no longer exported.


# tidypolars 0.1.0

## New features

* Support `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, `as.logical()`, `grepl()`, and
  `paste()` in expressions in `pl_filter()`, `pl_mutate()` and `pl_summarize()`.
  
* Support `sink_parquet()` (#38).

* Support `fetch()` (#42).

* Support for additional `stringr` functions: `str_detect()`, `str_extract_all()`,
  `str_pad()`, `str_squish()`, `str_trim()`, `word()` (some arguments or corner 
  cases are not supported yet).

* Add all optimization parameters in `collect()`.

## Bug fixes

* Fix `pl_mutate()` and `pl_summarize()` when expressions use some variables 
  previously created or modified (#10, #37).
  
* Fix bug in `pl_filter()` when passing a vector in the RHS of `%in%`.
  
## Misc

* Improve the backend to translate R expressions into Polars expressions. This
  also led to a complete rewriting of the vignette "R and Polars expressions" 
  (#27).
  
* Error messages should now report the correct function call.

* Improve CI coverage (#35).



# tidypolars 0.0.1
