# tidypolars: More Efficient Tidyverse Code, Using Polars in the Background

Polars is a cross-language tool for manipulating very large data.
However, one drawback is that the R implementation has a syntax that
will look odd to many R users who are not used to Python syntax. The
objective of tidypolars is to improve the ease-of-use of Polars in R by
providing tidyverse syntax to polars.
