\item{.data}{A Polars LazyFrame.}

\item{path}{Output file. Can also be a \verb{partition_*()} function to export the
output to multiple files (see Details section below).}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\item{maintain_order}{Whether maintain the order the data was processed
(default is \code{TRUE}). Setting this to \code{FALSE} will be slightly faster.}

\item{type_coercion}{Coerce types such that operations succeed and run on
minimal required memory (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{predicate_pushdown}{Applies filters as early as possible at scan level
(default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{projection_pushdown}{Select only the columns that are needed at the
scan level (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{simplify_expression}{Various optimizations, such as constant folding
and replacing expensive operations with faster alternatives (default is
\code{TRUE}).}

\item{slice_pushdown}{Only load the required slice from the scan. Don't
materialize sliced outputs level. Don't materialize sliced outputs (default
is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{no_optimization}{Sets the following optimizations to \code{FALSE}:
\code{predicate_pushdown}, \code{projection_pushdown},  \code{slice_pushdown},
\code{simplify_expression}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{mkdir}{Recursively create all the directories in the path.}

\value{
The input LazyFrame.

\description{
This writes the output of a query directly to a NDJSON file without collecting
it in the R session first. This is useful if the output of the query is still
larger than RAM as it would crash the R session if it was collected into R.

\subsection{Partitioned output}{

It is possible to export a LazyFrame to multiple files, also called
\emph{partitioned output}. A partition can be determined in several ways:
\itemize{
\item by key(s): split by the values of keys. The amount of files that can be
written is not limited. However, when writing beyond a certain amount of
files, the data for the remaining partitions is buffered before writing to
the file.
\item by maximum number of rows: if the number of rows in a file reaches the
maximum number of rows, the file is closed and a new file is opened.
}

These partitioning schemes can be used with the functions \code{partition_by_key()}
and \code{partition_by_max_size()}. See Examples below.

Writing a partitioned output usually requires setting \code{mkdir = TRUE} to
automatically create the required subfolders.

# This is an example workflow where sink_ndjson() is not very useful because
# the data would fit in memory. It simply is an example of using it at the
# end of a piped workflow.

# Create files for the NDJSON input and output:
file_ndjson <- tempfile(fileext = ".ndjson")
file_ndjson2 <- tempfile(fileext = ".ndjson")

# Write some data in a CSV file
fake_data <- do.call("rbind", rep(list(mtcars), 1000))
yyjsonr::write_ndjson_file(fake_data, file_ndjson)

# In a new R session, we could read this file as a LazyFrame, do some operations,
# and write it to another NDJSON file without ever collecting it in the R session:
scan_ndjson_polars(file_ndjson) |>
  filter(cyl \%in\% c(4, 6), mpg > 22) |>
  mutate(
    hp_gear_ratio = hp / gear
  ) |>
  sink_ndjson(path = file_ndjson2)

# Write a LazyFrame to multiple files depending on various strategies.

# Split the LazyFrame by key(s) and write each split to a different file:
