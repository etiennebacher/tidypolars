\arguments{
\item{.data}{A Polars LazyFrame.}

\item{path}{Output file.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\item{compression}{\code{NULL} or a character of the compression method,
\code{"uncompressed"} or "lz4" or "zstd". \code{NULL} is equivalent to \code{"uncompressed"}.
Choose "zstd" for good compression performance. Choose "lz4"
for fast compression/decompression.}

\item{maintain_order}{Whether maintain the order the data was processed
(default is \code{TRUE}). Setting this to \code{FALSE} will be slightly faster.}

\item{type_coercion}{Coerce types such that operations succeed and run on
minimal required memory (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{predicate_pushdown}{Applies filters as early as possible at scan level
(default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{projection_pushdown}{Select only the columns that are needed at the
scan level (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{simplify_expression}{Various optimizations, such as constant folding
and replacing expensive operations with faster alternatives (default is
\code{TRUE}).}

\item{slice_pushdown}{Only load the required slice from the scan. Don't
materialize sliced outputs level. Don't materialize sliced outputs (default
is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{no_optimization}{Sets the following optimizations to \code{FALSE}:
\code{predicate_pushdown}, \code{projection_pushdown},  \code{slice_pushdown},
\code{simplify_expression}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{inherit_optimization}{Use existing optimization settings regardless of
the settings specified in this function call. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The input LazyFrame.
}
\description{
This function allows to stream a LazyFrame that is larger than RAM directly
to an IPC file without collecting it in the R session, thus preventing
crashes because of too small memory.
