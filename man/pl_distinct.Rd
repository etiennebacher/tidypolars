\title{Remove duplicated rows in a Data/LazyFrame}
\usage{
pl_distinct(.data, ..., keep = "first", maintain_order = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A Polars Data/LazyFrame}

\item{...}{Any expression accepted by \code{dplyr::select()}: variable names,
column numbers, select helpers, etc.}

\item{keep}{Either "first" (keep the first occurrence of the duplicated row),
"last" (last occurrence) or "none" (remove all ofccurences of duplicated
rows).}

\item{maintain_order}{Maintain row order. This is the default but it can
slow down the process with large datasets and it prevents the use of
streaming.}
}
\description{
By default, duplicates are looked for in all variables. It is possible to
specify a subset of variables where duplicates should be looked for. It is
also possible to keep either the first occurrence, the last occurence or
remove all duplicates.

\examples{
pl_test <- polars::pl$DataFrame(

  iso_d = rep(c("BA", "BB", "BC"), each = 2),
  value = 1:6
)
