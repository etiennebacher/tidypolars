Title: Provide the Functionalities of Polars with the Syntax of the Tidyverse
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Etienne",
           family = "Bacher",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
           email = "etienne.bacher@protonmail.com")
Description: Polars is an amazing cross-language tool for manipulating very large
    data. However, one drawback is that the R implementation has a syntax that
    will look odd to many R users who are not used to Python syntax. The objective
    of tidypolars is to improve the ease-of-use of Polars in R by providing
    functions whose names and syntax are very close to the tidyverse ones, while
    having very few dependencies.
