# Contributing to tidypolars

This outlines how to propose a change to **tidypolars**. 

## Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in vignettes can be fixed directly on the Github
interface since vignettes are automatically rendered by `pkgdown`.

Fixing typos in the documentation of functions (those in the "Reference" page) 
requires editing the source in the corresponding `.R` file and then run 
`devtools::document()`. *Do not edit an `.Rd` file in `man/`*.

## Filing an issue

The easiest way to propose a change or new feature is to file an issue. If
you've found a bug, you may also create an associated issue. If possible, try to
illustrate your proposal or the bug with a minimal [reproducible
example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).


## Pull requests

### General information

*  Please create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  tidypolars uses [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html),
for documentation.
*  If your PR is a user-visible change, you may add a bullet point in `NEWS.md` 
   describing the changes made. You may optionally add your GitHub username, and 
   links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).

### How to add support for an R function in `tidypolars`?

If you use a function that is not supported, `tidypolars` will throw an error.
This doesn't mean that `tidypolars` cannot support it, simply that it is not
implemented yet. `tidypolars` can technically support hundreds of functions that
manipulate numbers, strings, or dates, and those are not limited to the
`tidyverse`.

The first step when you come across an unsupported function is to find the
corresponding syntax in `polars`. Just for the example, suppose that
`stringr::str_ends()` is not yet supported (it actually is). We first define a
simple test `data.frame` and its `DataFrame` counterpart in `polars`:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(stringr)
library(polars)

test <- tibble(x = c("abc", "a1", "dac"))
test_pl <- pl$DataFrame(x = c("abc", "a1", "dac"))
```

Then, find the `polars` syntax that gives the same output as `stringr::str_ends()`. In this case, `polars` has a string methods `$ends_with()`:

```{r}
test |> 
  mutate(ends_with_c = str_ends(x, "c"))

test_pl$with_columns(
  ends_with_c = pl$col("x")$str$ends_with("c")
)
```

What interests us is the expression inside the `$with_columns()` call. Now that
we know the `polars` translation, let's put this in a function that `tidypolars`
will know. Internally, `tidypolars` will prefix the function name (`str_ends`)
with `pl_` and look for it in the translated functions.

Depending on the function we translate, it can be stored in different places.
This function only works on strings, we can store it in
[`R/funs-string.R`](https://github.com/etiennebacher/tidypolars/blob/main/R/funs-string.R).
Once we add support for the `negate` argument, this is what it will look like:

```{r}
pl_str_ends <- function(string, pattern, negate = FALSE, ...) {
  check_empty_dots(...)
  out <- string$str$ends_with(pattern)
  if (isTRUE(negate)) {
    out$not()
  } else {
    out
  }
}
```

The `check_empty_dots(...)` is here to grab all additional arguments that
`stringr::str_ends()` might have and ignore them because they have no
counterparts in `polars` (it also adds a message warning the user that these
arguments are not used).

Once the package is reloaded, we can use this function in a `tidypolars` workflow:

```{r}
library(tidypolars, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

test_pl |> 
  mutate(ends_with_c = str_ends(x, "c"))
```

Finally, the only thing left to do is to add some tests in the `tests/tinytest` 
folder.
