## Overview

`tidypolars` provides a [`polars`](https://rpolars.github.io/) backend for the
`tidyverse`. The aim of `tidypolars` is to enable users to keep their existing
`tidyverse` code while using `polars` in the background to benefit from large
performance gains. The only thing that needs to change is the way data is
imported in the R session.

See the ["Getting started" vignette](https://tidypolars.etiennebacher.com/articles/tidypolars)
for a gentle introduction to `tidypolars`.

Since most of the work is rewriting `tidyverse` code into `polars` syntax,
`tidypolars` and `polars` have very similar performance.

The main purpose of this benchmark is to show that `polars` and `tidypolars` are
close and to give an idea of the performance. For more thorough, representative
benchmarks about `polars`, take a look at [DuckDB benchmarks](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/) instead.

```{r}
# library(collapse, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
# library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
# library(dtplyr)
# library(polars)
# library(tidypolars)

# large_iris <- data.table::rbindlist(rep(list(iris), 100000))
# large_iris_pl <- as_polars_lf(large_iris)
# large_iris_dt <- lazy_dt(large_iris)

# format(nrow(large_iris), big.mark = ",")

# bench::mark(
#   polars = {
#     large_iris_pl$
#       select(c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"))$
#       with_columns(
#         pl$when(
#           (pl$col("Petal.Length") / pl$col("Petal.Width") > 3)
#         )$then(pl$lit("long"))$
#           otherwise(pl$lit("large"))$
#           alias("petal_type")
#       )$
#       filter(pl$col("Sepal.Length")$is_between(4.5, 5.5))$
#       collect()
#   },
#   tidypolars = {
#     large_iris_pl |>
#       select(starts_with(c("Sep", "Pet"))) |>
#       mutate(
#         petal_type = ifelse((Petal.Length / Petal.Width) > 3, "long", "large")
#       ) |>
#       filter(between(Sepal.Length, 4.5, 5.5)) |>
#       compute()

#       mutate(

#       ) |>
#       filter(between(Sepal.Length, 4.5, 5.5)) |>
#       as.data.frame()
#   },
#   collapse = {
#     large_iris |>
#       fselect(c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")) |>
#       fmutate(
#         petal_type = data.table::fifelse((Petal.Length / Petal.Width) > 3, "long", "large")
#       ) |>
#       fsubset(Sepal.Length >= 4.5 & Sepal.Length <= 5.5)
#   },
#   check = FALSE,
#   iterations = 40
# )

# NOTE: do NOT take the "mem_alloc" results into account.
# `bench::mark()` doesn't report the accurate memory usage for packages calling
# Rust code.

## Installation

`tidypolars` is built on `polars`, which is not available on CRAN. This means
that `tidypolars` also can't be on CRAN. However, you can install it from
R-universe.

```{r eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true")
install.packages("tidypolars", repos = c("https://community.r-multiverse.org", 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

The development version contains the latest improvements and bug fixes:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("etiennebacher/tidypolars")
```


## Related work

Several packages have been developed to handle large data more efficiently while keeping the `tidyverse` syntax.

* [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/): one of the closest alternatives to `tidypolars`. Also has lazy evaluation and query optimizations, uses Acero in the background to translate dplyr queries to `arrow`.
  - **How is tidypolars different?**: Polars (and therefore `tidypolars`) uses an unofficial Arrow memory specification but all operations are implemented (and optimized) from scratch. The query optimizations can therefore be very different. The list of R functions that are translated to the Arrow engine may also differ.

* [`collapse`](https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/): has very fast operations but still needs to import all data into memory, which prevents using larger-than-RAM datasets.
  - **How is tidypolars different?**: `tidypolars` provides lazy evaluation that is more memory-efficient since it doesn't import all data in memory. It also provides a streaming engine to handle larger-than-RAM datasets.

* [`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/): allows using `dplyr` for data stored in a relational database by translating R code to SQL queries. The performance will therefore depend on the SQL backend used.
  - **How is tidypolars different?**: `tidypolars` doesn't translate R code to SQL but directly evaluates it with Polars.

* [`dtplyr`](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/): uses `data.table` in the background for better performance but needs to import all data in memory, which prevents using larger-than-RAM datasets.
  - **How is tidypolars different?**: same as for `collapse`.

* [`duckplyr`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/): one of the closest alternatives to `tidypolars`. Uses DuckDB in the background, also provides lazy evaluation and query optimizations. Can perform operations directly on R `data.frame`s.
  - **How is tidypolars different?**: similar to `arrow`, the list of R functions that are optimized in Polars or DuckDB isn't identical so the use case will determine which tool runs the fastest. `duckplyr` also relies on a fallback mechanism that will run the code in "standard R" if the function cannot be translated. `tidypolars` is more conservative and will error in this case, avoiding importing data that may crash the session because of its size.

* [`sparklyr`](https://spark.posit.co/): uses Apache Spark in the background, requires installing Spark. Can perform distributed processing.
  - **How is tidypolars different?**: `tidypolars` doesn't need installing another tool and performs better than Spark.


Therefore, if you need to handle data that is larger than memory, you have three options: `arrow`, `duckplyr`, and `tidypolars`.
The best one will probably depend on the use case and on your constraints (e.g. `tidypolars` is available via R-universe but isn't on CRAN).
Regarding performance, one should refer to the [DuckDB benchmarks](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/) to compare tools.
Keep in mind that accurately benchmarking data processing tools is hard, those benchmarks give indications but don't necessarily apply to all contexts.
